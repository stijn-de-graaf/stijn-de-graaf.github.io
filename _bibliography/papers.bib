  abstract = "Quantum control of a linear oscillator using a static dispersive
              coupling to a nonlinear ancilla underpins a wide variety of
              experiments in circuit QED. Extending this control to more than
              one oscillator while minimizing the required connectivity to the
              ancilla would enable hardware-efficient multi-mode entanglement
              and measurements. We show that the spectrum of an ancilla
              statically coupled to a single mode can be made to depend on the
              joint photon number in two modes by applying a strong parametric
              beamsplitter coupling between them. This `joint-photon
              number-splitting' regime extends single-oscillator techniques to
              two-oscillator control, which we use to realize a
              hardware-efficient erasure check for a dual-rail qubit encoded in
              two superconducting cavities. This scheme leverages the
              high-fidelity beamsplitter coupling already required for single-
              and two-qubit gates while permitting minimal crosstalk between
              circuit elements. Furthermore, the flexibility to choose the
              pulse shape allows us to limit the susceptibility to different
              error channels. We use this scheme to detect leakage errors with
              a missed erasure fraction of (9.0 $\pm$ 0.5) $\times$ 10−4 while
              incurring an erasure rate of 2.92 $\pm$ 0.01\% and a Pauli error
              rate of 0.31 $\pm$ 0.01\%, both of which are dominated by cavity
              errors.",

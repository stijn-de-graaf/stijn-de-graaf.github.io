  abstract = "Quantum control of a linear oscillator using a static dispersive
              coupling to a nonlinear ancilla underpins a wide variety of
              experiments in circuit QED. Extending this control to more than
              one oscillator while minimizing the required connectivity to the
              ancilla would enable hardware-efficient multi-mode entanglement
              and measurements. We show that the spectrum of an ancilla
              statically coupled to a single mode can be made to depend on the
              joint photon number in two modes by applying a strong parametric
              beamsplitter coupling between them. This `joint-photon
              number-splitting' regime extends single-oscillator techniques to
              two-oscillator control, which we use to realize a
              hardware-efficient erasure check for a dual-rail qubit encoded in
              two superconducting cavities. This scheme leverages the
              high-fidelity beamsplitter coupling already required for single-
              and two-qubit gates while permitting minimal crosstalk between
              circuit elements. Furthermore, the flexibility to choose the
              pulse shape allows us to limit the susceptibility to different
              error channels. We use this scheme to detect leakage errors with
              a missed erasure fraction of (9.0 $\pm$ 0.5) $\times$ 10−4 while
              incurring an erasure rate of 2.92 $\pm$ 0.01\% and a Pauli error
              rate of 0.31 $\pm$ 0.01\%, both of which are dominated by cavity
              errors.",

  abstract = {Here, we propose an architecture for quantum computing that applies the dual-rail encoding from quantum optics to a superconducting quantum circuit platform. In doing so, we not only benefit from the error detection properties of this encoding but also exploit the strong nonlinearities available in superconducting circuits, which enable gate-based quantum computation. While any useful quantum computer is expected to need quantum error correction, direct error detection allows us to know exactly where and when a qubit has an error, making error correction much easier. By designing the dual-rail qubits such that most of their errors can be detected, we believe that practical quantum error correction can already be achieved with the coherence times of today’s superconducting circuits. The design of quantum hardware that reduces and mitigates errors is essential for practical quantum error correction (QEC) and useful quantum computation. To this end, we introduce the circuit-Quantum Electrodynamics (QED) dual-rail qubit in which our physical qubit is encoded in the single-photon subspace, {|01〉,|10〉}, of two superconducting microwave cavities. The dominant photon loss errors can be detected and converted into erasure errors, which are in general much easier to correct. In contrast to linear optics, a circuit-QED implementation of the dual-rail code offers unique capabilities. Using just one additional transmon ancilla per dual-rail qubit, we describe how to perform a gate-based set of universal operations that includes state preparation, logical readout, and parametrizable single and two-qubit gates. Moreover, first-order hardware errors in the cavities and the transmon can be detected and converted to erasure errors in all operations, leaving background Pauli errors that are orders of magnitude smaller. Hence, the dual-rail cavity qubit exhibits a favorable hierarchy of error rates and is expected to perform well below the relevant QEC thresholds with today’s coherence times.}

  abstract = "A critical challenge in developing scalable quantum systems is
              correcting the accumulation of errors while performing operations
              and measurements. It is known that systems where dominant errors
              can be detected and converted into erasures have relaxed
              requirements for quantum error correction. Recently, it has been
              proposed that this can be achieved using a dual-rail encoding of
              quantum information in the microwave photon states of two
              superconducting cavities. One necessary step to realize this
              erasure qubit is to demonstrate a measurement and to flag errors
              as erasures. In this work, we demonstrate a projective logical
              measurement of a dual-rail cavity qubit with integrated erasure
              detection and measure the qubit idling errors. We measure the
              logical state preparation and measurement errors at the 0.01\%
              level and detect over 99\% of the cavity decay events as
              erasures. We use the precision of this measurement protocol to
              distinguish different types of error in this system, finding that
              although decay errors occur with a probability of approximately
              0.2\% per microsecond, phase errors occur 6 times less frequently
              and bit flips occur at least 150 times less frequently. These
              findings represent a confirmation of the expected error hierarchy
              necessary to concatenate dual-rail cavity qubits into a highly
              efficient erasure code.",

              error correction by redundantly encoding quantum information in
              the large Hilbert space of a harmonic oscillator. However,
              experimental realizations of these codes are often limited by
              ancilla errors propagating to the encoded logical qubit during
              syndrome measurements. The Kerr-cat qubit has been proposed as an
              ancilla for these codes due to its theoretically-exponential
              noise bias, which would enable fault-tolerant error syndrome
              measurements, but the coupling required to perform these syndrome
              measurements has not yet been demonstrated. In this work, we
              experimentally realize driven parametric coupling of a Kerr-cat
              qubit to a high-quality-factor microwave cavity and demonstrate a
              gate set that would enable universal quantum control of the
              cavity. We measure the decoherence of the cavity in the presence
              of the Kerr-cat and discover excess dephasing due to heating of
              the Kerr-cat to excited states. By engineering
              frequency-selective dissipation to counteract this heating, we
              are able to eliminate this dephasing, thereby demonstrating a
              high on-off ratio of control. Our results pave the way toward

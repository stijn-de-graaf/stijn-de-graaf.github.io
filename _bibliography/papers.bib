  abstract = "Quantum control of a linear oscillator using a static dispersive
              coupling to a nonlinear ancilla underpins a wide variety of
              experiments in circuit QED. Extending this control to more than
              one oscillator while minimizing the required connectivity to the
              ancilla would enable hardware-efficient multi-mode entanglement
              and measurements. We show that the spectrum of an ancilla
              statically coupled to a single mode can be made to depend on the
              joint photon number in two modes by applying a strong parametric
              beamsplitter coupling between them. This `joint-photon
              number-splitting' regime extends single-oscillator techniques to
              two-oscillator control, which we use to realize a
              hardware-efficient erasure check for a dual-rail qubit encoded in
              two superconducting cavities. This scheme leverages the
              high-fidelity beamsplitter coupling already required for single-
              and two-qubit gates while permitting minimal crosstalk between
              circuit elements. Furthermore, the flexibility to choose the
              pulse shape allows us to limit the susceptibility to different
              error channels. We use this scheme to detect leakage errors with
              a missed erasure fraction of (9.0 $\pm$ 0.5) $\times$ 10−4 while
              incurring an erasure rate of 2.92 $\pm$ 0.01\% and a Pauli error
              rate of 0.31 $\pm$ 0.01\%, both of which are dominated by cavity
              errors.",

  title={Can Quantum-Mechanical Description of Physical Reality Be Considered Complete?},
  author={Einstein*†, A. and Podolsky*, B. and Rosen*, N.},
  abstract={In a complete theory there is an element corresponding to each element of reality. A sufficient condition for the reality of a physical quantity is the possibility of predicting it with certainty, without disturbing the system. In quantum mechanics in the case of two physical quantities described by non-commuting operators, the knowledge of one precludes the knowledge of the other. Then either (1) the description of reality given by the wave function in quantum mechanics is not complete or (2) these two quantities cannot have simultaneous reality. Consideration of the problem of making predictions concerning a system on the basis of measurements made on another system that had previously interacted with it leads to the result that if (1) is false then (2) is also false. One is thus led to conclude that the description of reality as given by a wave function is not complete.},
